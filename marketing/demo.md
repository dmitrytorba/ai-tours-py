Do you ever go to a new place and wonder what is around you?
Do you ever wish you could have a magical tour guide to tell you history and factoids about where you are?

Well, you are in luck because this app is for you!

As you can see it knows exactly where you are.  It knows all of wikipedia, so it can give you a tour of any point on the planet.

Here, for example, its telling us about my ... [describe results]

Whats more is that you can direct the tour in any direction you desire. Say you want to see whats around you.... [ask whats nearby]

But what if you want to explore a place thats far away? Well you can do that as well, all
you need to do is ask... [ask to go to sf]

As you can see, the AI is now giving us a tour of San Francisco.  Once again we can direct the tour with our questions ... [ask about history]

Furthermore, the tour guide is just like a human, it knows the context of your questions. 
For example we can ask ... [ask to take to the bridge]

And of course, the AI knows that since we are in SF the only bridge of any importance is the Golden Gate.

Lastly, this web app is mobile responsive, so you can literally have your own personal tour guide in pocket.

Thanks and I wish you a lot of great tours.
